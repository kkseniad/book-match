# Book Match

**Stop wasting time on books you won't like - get recommendations from readers who've already proven they have your taste.**
A web application that helps book lovers discover their next great read through personalized recommendations from readers with similar taste.

## The Problem
Book readers struggle to find their next book because they can't trust recommendations from strangers. Reviews on platforms like Goodreads or Amazon come from people with completely different reading preferences - a romance reader's 5-star review doesn't help a sci-fi enthusiast. This leads to wasted time browsing, disappointing book choices, or endlessly re-reading familiar favorites.
## The Solution
Book Match uses a taste-matching algorithm to connect you with readers who share your reading history. If someone has read 8+ of the same books you have, their recommendations are likely to match your taste. No more guessing - just personalized book suggestions from people who read like you.
