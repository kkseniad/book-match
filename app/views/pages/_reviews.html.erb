        "I really like the interface, everything looks clean and modern. It’s very easy to search for books and add them and keep track of my books.  I’m in a book club, and sometimes I forget what I’ve read and what I haven’t, especially over the past year, and this app really helps with that. Everything feels intuitive and easy to use. Looking forward to using the app more."

        "The interface on Book Match is very pleasing to the eye and intuitive! Also, the book catalog is impressively extensive! I think the platform has huge potential, and can be developed even further, growing and attracting more people to reading based on their sometimes quite narrow preferences."
